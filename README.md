# Use Case

Generative AI has numerous real-life applications and is an essential tool for enhancing productivity and efficiency. I recently had to handle a credit card dispute with a bank, which took over 40 days to resolveâ€”well beyond their service level agreement. During this process, the call center advisor suggested me  write down the details of the dispute and email them to a central email. Given the variability in dispute amounts and case complexities, I believe a Gen AI tool that can summarize file content and answer related questions would be ideal for improving customer services.
